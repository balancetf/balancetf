## Disputed Change #1

### Changes from Stock
* Fires a single arrow instead of syringes.
    * Reload time is 2 seconds.
    * Heals teammates for 60 health at point blank, and up to 120 health at max range. This puts healing rate at 30HP/s at point blank, and 60HP/s at max range.
    * Builds ubercharge at a rate of 1% per 48 HP in combat, 1% per 16 HP out of combat.
    * Damage to enemies scales with distance, from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 40.

### Current Problems
Currently, the Crusader's Crossbow is simply the best item in its slot. Nothing matches its burst healing potential of an obscene 93.75HP/s at maximum range and its ability to build ubercharge. Since the medic's role is to heal, and not to do damage, it stands to reason that the medic should not be able to do 75 instant damage at long range.

### Explanation of Changes
Increasing the reload time from 1.6s to 2s makes the high healing per second of the Crusader's Crossbow easier to counter with high amounts of burst damage. Even still, that puts its max heal rate at 75HP/s which is still higher than the stock medi gun at maximum crit heals. Reducing its maximum healing per arrow puts healing per second at 60HP/s, which is much more sane and possible to fight against. Maximum damage is reduced to 40 to reduce the effectiveness of spam arrows.

### Additional Comments
This change is best looked at in context with the changes to the [Blutsauger](blutsauger.md#disputed-change-1) and [Syringe Gun](syringe-gun.md#disputed-change-1) as well. They are designed to be balanced around each other.
