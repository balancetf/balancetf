## Proposed Change
...

## Disputed Change #1

### Changes from Stock
This is a stock weapon, so consider these to be changes from the stats in the tables above.
* Syringes heal teammates at a rate of 4 health per syringe (max 40 health/s)
    * Does not overheal.
    * Does not build ubercharge.

### Current Problems
The Syringe Gun is currently used extremely rarely because it doesn't have high (or any) healing potential like the Crusader's Crossbow. Its damage is relatively okay, but doing damage is not the medic's role.

### Explanation of Changes
Allowing the Syringe Gun to heal at 40 health/s gives it the use of quickly topping up a hurt teammate, even in combat, at a rate faster than medi guns. This comes with the tradeoff of it not building ubercharge.

### Additional Comments
This change is best looked at in context with our proposed changes to the Blutsauger and Crusader's Crossbow as well. They are designed to be balanced around each other.
