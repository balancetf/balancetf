## Proposed Change
...

## Disputed Change #1

### Changes from Stock
* Syringes heal teammates at a rate of 2 health per syringe (max 20 health/s)
    * Healing done with this weapon is returned to the medic at half the rate. So for every 20 health given to teammates, the medic gets 10 in return.
    * Does not build ubercharge.

### Current Problems
Currently, the blutsauger is simply not good enough. It passively drains the user's health by 2 per second and the positive side of the weapon (currently heals for 3 HP when hitting an enemy) requires the medic to stop healing his team. Because of the passive HP drain, he'd have to stop healing his team quite often to survive, or steal a large amount of health packs, which is a huge disadvantage.

### Explanation of Changes
By eliminating the passive health degeneration and moving the healing mechanic to one that encourages healing teammates, the medic can now take advantage of this weapon's upside without letting his teammates die. It doesn't have the burst healing potential of the currently most used item in its slot, the Crusader's Crossbow, but it trades this off for the ability to sustain the medic's own life.
