### Current Problems
The vanilla dalokohs bar loses to other lunch box items in most cases. It doesn't regenerate as fast as second banana, it doesn't heal you or teammates as much as regular sandwich. The only unique thing the dalokohs does it that it buffs your max health and gives you some overheal. The max health only makes a big difference when you're playing alone because it does not increase your max overheal and the overheal it gives is laughable and fades away faster than heavy can do anything with it.

### Explanation of Changes
We decided to make the dalonkohs more useful in more situations and giving it a niche that stacks up with the sandwich without having to be strictly better. It no longer increases max health, but it still heals or overheals for up to 100. In addition, the 30 second buff decreases the rate that you lose overheal to 2hp per second down from 10hp per second *[TF wiki](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Healing#Overheal)*. This effect synergizes with being alone, giving you a better buff than dalonkohs and synergizes well with medics, allowing them to give overheal to a heavy and not having to be attached to him to maintain it.
