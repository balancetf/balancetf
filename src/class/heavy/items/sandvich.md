\* - Scout heals for 75 HP when heavy drops a Sandvich on death. All other classes heal for 50. Changing this would break an existing achievement, and I don't think it's a big enough deal to change.

### Current Problems
Currently, the Sandvich is established as the best heavy secondary. This is due to the fact that the heavy can use it either to make himself more tanky or heal teammates with it with great effectiveness. No other secondaries can currently match it in this regard.

### Explanation of Changes
By having the heavy be healed all at once at the end of the eating animation, rather than being healed in 4 bursts of 75 HP throughout, it becomes much more of a risk to stop and eat the Sandvich. The heavy is at risk of being killed since he is immobile and preusmably at low health, but if he finishes, he is rewarded with full health. There is more of a purpose to shooting at a heavy who is eating since he's not regaining health at a very high rate. Hopefully this added risk would encourage players to consider other options in the same slot.

### Additional Comments
This change on its own is probably not enough to make other heavy secondaries viable, so this one should be considered as part of a larger set of changes which make other heavy secondaries better.
