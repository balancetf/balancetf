### Changes from Stock
Completely replace the minigun with a Burstgun:

* **This weapon fires in bursts.**

|--------------------|--------:|
| Hitscan/Projectile | Hitscan |

| Max falloff (50%)       |   5.5 / bullet |
| Crit                    |    33 / bullet |

| Function Times          |                |
|-------------------------|---------------:|
| Attack interval         |    0.3 seconds |
| Burst time              |   0.45 seconds |
| Reload (first)          |   0.75 seconds |
| Reload (consecutive)    |   0.55 seconds |

Notes:
Burst time is the amount of time that it takes for all bullets in a burst to be fired consecutively. Meaning that each bullet has an intermediate interval of `x รท n` where x is Burst time and n is the number of bullets fired.

### Current Problems
A lot of the skill involved in TF2 involves the complex and dynamic relationship between movement and aim. The Heavy is the only class that directly segregates these two features with the Windup mechanic on the Heavy's Minigun - from the time when windup starts to when the minigun is unwound, the player's movement speed is significantly slowed. The Minigun is also designed around random spread in order to reduce the effective range of the weapon, instead of relying on damage fall off and the player's ability to track when aiming.

Overall it seems that the the Heavy is a complete contradiction to the design of the rest of the classes, as it pertains to movement.

### Explanation of Changes
Removing the decoupling between movement and fighting, by removing the wind up mechanic, should introduce a healthier relationship between movement and fighting for this class. The overall damage output of the class has been reduced significantly, but the opportunities where the class can output damage have been increased significantly. The weapon still shoots a stream of bullets, but only for a short period of time, and with a delay between each burst of bullets. This inherently rewards players who have good aim and can reliably track their targets.

### Additional Comments
Originally, when designing this weapon, there was an additional mechanic called "Vulnerability" which would replace the ramp-up/fall-off of the Burstgun. Instead, all players had "Vulnerability" stat which starts at 0.5 by default. Damage caused by the Burstgun would increase the player's vulnerability by a proportional amount, capping off at 1.5. Vulnerability decreases back down to 0.5 over time. The damage done to players by the Burstgun would be multiplied by the effected players Vulnerability before being applied to the player.

I decided to scrap this mechanic. It was originally intended to further promote players who could track and aim effectively; but, in the end, I think it was too complicated and that a simpler solution was in order - which is what these changes are a conclusion to.

* This weapon shoots 3 bullets per ammo all at once, in a fixed-equilateral-triangle spread

### Current Problems
Heavy's low mobility and inconsistent damage makes him uninteresting to fight and play aginast. This combination forces heavy to be almost entirely based on positioning as to not be invalidated entirely as a class by splash damage and superior mobility. Such sluggish mobility and a reliance on positioning makes heavy's effectiveness be limited to areas where he has lots of time to get into position and setup, but without the guarenteed damage and utility that engineer has.

### Explanation of Changes
To address heavy's mobility, the windup and winddown time for minigun usage will be reduced drastically, allowing him to move more fluidly in and out of combat while still keeping his need for atleast some preparation and counter-play. He will also move faster while spun; at 56% speed up from 37% speed. This speed boost is to allow heavy to better use his awareness to dodge threats. The second issue to be addressed is the randomness in his damage output. Pre-change heavy did shoot multiple bullets for each ammo consumed, but the spread was chaotic. This new minigun will shoot 3 bullets simultaneously and in a fixed triangular spread, similar to a shotgun. In addition he will incur no accuracy ramp-up as to not punish heavy players for trying to stay mobile.

### Additional Comments
Although I believe this change is for the better, it may further invalidate the use of secondary shotguns on heavy. I believe this problem needs addressed anyway, whether or not this minigun design gets used.
