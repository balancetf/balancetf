### Changes from Stock
* +25% faster firing speed
* +50% max secondary ammo
* +6 max stickies out
 Detonates stickybombs near the center of your crosshair
* -0.8 arm time

### Current Problems
At the current moment the Scottish Resistance is very keenly balanced to fill it's niche of being a dedicated area denial counter-part to the stock stickybomb launcher. Valve had added the ability of this weapon to detonate all stickies "At your feet" (in a radius around you) in order to assist sticky jumping. This mechanic makes setting up traps and being in the same room as your stickies a incredible hazard for accident death and makes the already high skill floor for this weapon even higher. Overall the mechanic does more harm than good.

### Explanation of Changes
The Scottish Resistance will now only detonate stickies you are looking at. The mechanic of proximity detonation is not nessesary for sticky jumping as, just like soldiers, the demo can look at the source of the explosion he wants to jump off of.
