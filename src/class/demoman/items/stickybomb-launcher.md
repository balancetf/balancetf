## Proposed Change

## Disputed Change #1

### Changes from Stock
This is a stock item, so consider changes to be from the stats in the tables above.
* Random deviation is removed.
    * As this is a stock weapon, this change should affect all derivations of it (Scottish Resistance, Quickiebomb Launcher, Sticky Jumper).

### Current Problems
The stickybomb launcher as it is is very balanced, the only problem is that it is not 100% predictable where stickies will land. The deviation is very slight, but it can become troublesome if the demoman is trying to conceal a sticky trap in a precise location.

### Explanation of Changes
With the removal of random deviation, there is no chance for a demoman to have his sticky traps exposed to the enemy just because of him being unlucky.
