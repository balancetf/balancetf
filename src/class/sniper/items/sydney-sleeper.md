## Proposed Change

## Disputed Change #1

#### Changes from Stock
* This weapon cannot charge.
* Headshotting enemies will build up a meter that allows the sniper to shoot his teammates to heal them.
    * This meter has a maximum value of 300.
    * Damage dealt by headshots is returned as meter. For example, a 140 damage headshot will return 140 meter.
    * Teammates are healed for half the damage a shot would do to an enemy. This means headshotting teammates heals them faster.
    * Healing teammates depletes meter equal to the amount of health healed.
    * This cannot overheal teammates.

#### Current Problems
Currently, I feel it's too easy to be effective with the Sydney Sleeper without hitting headshots because of the weapon's increased charge rate compared to stock and its jarate effect. Additionally, because it applies jarate, it allows the sniper to stand outside the effective range of other classes and effectively increase the effective range of his own teammates, as mini-crits ignore damage falloff. As a result, I feel it's too easy for a sniper to do 150 damage without any potential for retaliation, and also make it significantly more difficult to escape after the damage is done.

#### Explanation of Changes
The goal of this change is more to make the sniper class as a whole more interesting, rather than specifically the Sydney Sleeper. The meter for headshots mechanic rewards skilled players, and allows the sniper to have a purpose beyond getting one or two picks and letting his team push off of them. His ability to heal teammates would allow him to effectively participate in pushes initiated by the picks he gets.

Assuming a base damage of 50, and an attack interval of 1.5s, the sniper could heal teammates at about 16HP/second with bodyshots. Due to the 0.2 second delay between scoping and being able to headshot, the potential healing rate with headshots would be about 44HP/second.

The meter cap of 300 is to ensure that the sniper still has to hit headshots to consistently put out healing.

#### Additional Comments
During some discussion of this idea, it was brought up that it might be quite annoying to be fighting a player who gets unexpectedly healed for up to 75 HP by a sniper during a fight. I don't think this is a major issue, however, as it would be very easy to keep track of exactly how much meter the sniper has, since it's very easy to keep track of when an enemy sniper hits headshots. Therefore you can be prepared for anyone you're fighting to be healed.
