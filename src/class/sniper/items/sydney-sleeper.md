## Proposed Change

## Disputed Change #1

#### Changes from Stock
* This weapon cannot charge.
* Headshotting enemies will build up a meter that allows the sniper to shoot his teammates to heal them.
    * This meter has a maximum value of 300.
    * Damage dealt by headshots is returned as meter. For example, a 140 damage headshot will return 140 meter.
    * Teammates are healed at half the rate enemies are damaged, e.g. bodyshots heal teammates for 25 HP, headshots heal for 75 HP.
    * Healing teammates depletes meter equal to the amount of health healed.
    * This cannot overheal teammates.

#### Current Problems
Currently, I feel it's too easy to be effective with the Sydney Sleeper without hitting headshots because of the weapon's increased charge rate compared to stock and its jarate effect. Additionally, because it applies jarate, it allows the sniper to stand outside the effective range of other classes and effectively increase the effective range of his own teammates, as mini-crits ignore damage falloff. As a result, I feel it's too easy for a sniper to do 150 damage without any potential for retaliation, and also make it significantly more difficult to escape after the damage is done.

#### Explanation of Changes
It seems clear that the TF team wants this rifle to fill a support niche. I feel that my proposed changes would reward skilled players for hitting headshots more than the current design, and not do so by applying an arguably unfun effect to the enemy, but by allowing him to help his teammates. One might be concerned about the fact that a sniper can slightly more than double the healing rate of a medi gun on an in-combat patient. I think that this benefit is sufficiently offset by the following factors:

* The weapon cannot overheal like the medi gun can.
* This healing rate is not sustainable over long periods, as the sniper's healing pool is limited until he headshots more enemies.
* The sniper has to hit headshots on his teammates to achieve this, which is significantly more difficult than holding a beam on them.

Additionally, in the current state of 6v6 TF2, the sniper is mostly used for the purpose of breaking stalemates. However, unless the sniper is incredibly skilled, he usually doesn't see much use beyond getting one or two picks for his team to agress off of. I think this would give the sniper more use in team fights.

#### Additional Comments
During some discussion of this idea, it was brought up that it might be quite annoying to be fighting a player who gets unexpectedly healed for up to 75 HP by a sniper mid-fight. I don't think this is a major issue, however, as it would be very easy to keep track of exactly how much meter the sniper has, since it's very easy to keep track of when an enemy sniper hits headshots.
