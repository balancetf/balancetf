### Changes from Stock
This is a stock weapon, so all changes will be differences from its current state (written Sep 18, 2018.)
* Reload speed is consistent between classes
    * The result is the engineer having the scout's current reload time of 1.25s.
* Reserve ammo is consistent across classes
    * The result is the engineer having the scout's current reserve ammo of 36.
* Random spread is removed
* Minimum damage is 4 (down from 8)


### Current Problems
In its current state, the Pistol is quite balanced. The problem is the fact that hitting shots from any distance other than point blank is very dependent on luck.

### Explanation of Changes
As explained in the global changes section, random spread will either punish a player for aiming well, or reward a player for not aiming well enough. By removing random spread, this is no longer true. The Pistol's minimum damage is reduced to half of its current value to prevent it from being too destructive from long ranges, since it would have perfect accuracy.
