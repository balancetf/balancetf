# Frequently Asked Questions

These are questions we think will be frequently asked, or are indeed asked often. Most of this information is available elsewhere in the book but may not be immediately apparent.

If you don't see your question on here, drop us a line in [the discord server](https://discord.gg/7GmCDUP).

## How does a proposal become 'Approved'?

Approval happens when an existing Disputed Proposal is Championed for Approval. Proposal Champions are created by Maintainers of the repository, and are usually created based off of the popularity and stability of existing Disputed Proposal.

When a Proposal Champion is created, the community will be asked to vote on the proposed change. If you want to vote on incoming Champions, then [join the discord server where the polls take place](https://discord.gg/7GmCDUP)!

## How do I propose my own changes?
