## Removal of Random Spread
Every weapon that has any amount of random spread has it removed. Random spread creates 3 possible outcomes:
1. A player should hit a shot, but random spread causes them to miss.
2. A player should miss a shot, but random spread causes them to hit.
3. The same result as if random spread didn't exist at all.
Since the only results of random spread are either rewarding players for missing or punishing players for aiming well, let's just do away with it. However, this makes certain weapons become too powerful (e.g. the pistol). To counteract this, random spread will be replaced with harsher damage falloff and in some cases a lower minimum damage value.

The following weapons would be affected by this change:
* [Pistol](class/multiclass/items/pistol.md)
* [SMG](class/sniper/items/smg.md)
* [Grenade Launchers](class/demoman/demoman.md#grenade-launchers)
* [Stickybomb Launchers](class/demoman/demoman.md#stickybomb-launchers)
* [All Revolvers](class/spy/spy.md#revolvers)
* [Beggar's Bazooka](class/soldier/items/beggars-bazooka.md)
