# Foreword

The purpose of this book is to put forth some ideas on how to change some of the items in TF2 that are unbalanced.

It is highly encouraged for anyone reading this with their own ideas to make a pull request or issue on the [repository](https://github.com/phxvyper/tf-rebalance).
Before you do so, please read **[Contributing](contributing.md)**. It contains the rules for contributing, templates for PRs and issues, and explains what information is necessary to get your change merged.

It's important to remember that the maintainers are just people with opinions, so disagreements are inevitable. In order to remain as unbiased as possible, changes not yet reviewed either by the community at large or a handful of high level players will be listed as "disputed." Only after review will they be "approved" as the change that is definitely being proposed. **Approved changes are not final**. You are still welcome to propose tweaks to them.

# Balance Mod

Something we'd really like is to turn the changes proposed in this book into a playable mod. We'd host this mod on one or more servers to actually give them some thorough playtesting, therefore giving more credibility to the movement if they turn out well. If you're experienced with this kind of thing and are willing to help us realize it, please contact us in one of the following ways:
