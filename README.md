# Balance Mod

Something we'd really like is to turn the changes proposed in this book into a playable mod. We'd host this mod on one or more servers to actually give them some thorough playtesting, therefore giving more credibility to the movement if they turn out well. If you're experienced with this kind of thing and are willing to help us realize it, please contact us in one of the following ways:
